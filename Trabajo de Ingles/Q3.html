            <ul>
                <li>Know how to report, block, and filter content: Doing this can make you stay safe in the internet when someone harrass you or someone tries to send you some content that you shouldn’t see.</li>
                <li>Personalize your privacy settings: This makes you stay safe, talking only to people you know that are safe to talk.</li>
                <li>Pause before you post. First ask to yourself if you don’t care about sharing the information you want to post with everyone because this content can perfectly be a safety risk.</li>
                <li>Turn off geolocation: If you have geolocation activated and use a geotag to a Snapchat, update your Instagram story or you “check in” on Facebook, it means you are sharing your exact location with people you may or may not trust with it.</li>
                <li>Use a private Internet connection.</li>
                <li>Talk to your friends about public posts.</li>
                <li>Use safe security systems on your pc: Like antivirus that can revise your pc in search of posible virus you have.</li>
                <li>Report harassment or inappropriate content.</li>
                <li>Know the people you talk online.</li>
                <li>Look before you click.</li>
