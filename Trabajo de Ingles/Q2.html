                    Pretexting is the creation of a fake identity or scenario to trick a person into disclosing information.
                    For example, a scammer may email or call your company claiming to be a supplier, survey company, municipal inspector or insurance company to get sensitive data. A pretext attacker could also pose as a computer technician responding to a call for service to access your network.          
                <p>
                    Scammers may ask for little bits of information that don’t raise red flags, but over time, bit by bit, they’re trying to build a profile that can let them steal your identity.

                    Malicious software (or “malware”) is any software that has a harmful intent. It may steal or corrupt your business information, cause systems to fail or secretly record your computer activity. Malware usually infects a computer following a phishing attack or an employee accidentally downloading infected files.

                    Disposing of old devices improperly can hand someone else all your business information. If information is very sensitive, deleting data or formatting the hard drive isn’t enough. You may want to go as far as physically destroying the computer or hiring an expert to do that.
